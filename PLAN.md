# Harness Rewrite Plan

## Current checkpoint

- Phase: 2 — Durable tools and abort
- Work item: 2.5 — Durable sequential tool clearance and settlement
- Status: D-027 committed by `79797263b` after independent review; retained batch leases and clearance transactions are next
- Done bar: `prompt → tool call → durable tool result → model → final response` survives a crash at every boundary, with durable abort and terminal reconciliation
- Escalation policy: proceed automatically with the evidence-backed recommendation; ask only when available evidence cannot distinguish materially different outcomes

## Queue

1. Implement retained batch leases plus conditional clearance transactions.
2. Add Tier A/B/C clearance tests.
3. Independently review the complete clearance slice and rework any blockers.
4. Implement sequential execute/finalize and atomic real settlement.
5. Add replay/interrupted recovery, abort, crash matrix, and the Phase 2 gate.

## Phase order

1. Minimal durable run.
2. Durable tools and abort.
3. SQLite and production durability.
4. Queues and interactive control.
5. Hooks, events, and snapshots.
6. Compaction and navigation, then forks/subagents.
7. OpenCode-level product shell.
8. Amp-level remote execution.

## Priority fallback

1. Storage transactions/registers.
2. Minimal prompt run.
3. Crash restore/resume.
4. Durable sequential tools.
5. Abort/close.
6. SQLite.
7. Queues/steering/follow-up.
8. Events/watch.
9. Permissions/sandbox/worktrees.
10. Hooks.
11. Parallel tools.
12. Manual compaction.
13. Auto-compaction/overflow.
14. Multi-lane/navigation/fork.
15. Remote runners.
16. Advanced retention/schema evolution.

## Deferred

- JSONL unless required for product export, debug, or import.
- Postgres partitioning and retention daemon.
- Precise rewrite and general settlement-kernel migrations.
- Multi-lane, queues, compaction, navigation, and serving concerns until their ordered phases.
- Canonical extensible `AgentMessage` ownership and custom-role schemas until before custom messages or the product shell.
