# Harness Rewrite Plan

## Current checkpoint

- Phase: 3 — SQLite and production durability
- Work item: 3.3d — Ordinary bounded reads and shared backend conformance
- Status: D-038 passed corrected independent design review; ordinary-read implementation is next
- Done bar: Memory and SQLite pass one shared storage conformance suite; each Harness commit is one SQLite transaction using `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`; writer lease/fencing, reopen, and process-crash recovery are verified
- Escalation policy: proceed automatically with the evidence-backed recommendation; ask only when available evidence cannot distinguish materially different outcomes

## Queue

1. Implement the D-038 private read engine, handle admission, and shared seeded ordinary-read vectors.
2. Run complete Storage/SQLite tests, build, root check, and independent final review without claiming full Storage conformance.
3. Implement segmented entry projection, divergence, and guarded branch scans.
4. Add explicit repair and `SqliteSessionRepo` Harness integration.
5. Add storage, creation, and RuntimeShell subprocess crash matrices, then run whole-Phase-3 review and Recovery/QA.

## Phase order

1. Minimal durable run.
2. Durable tools and abort.
3. SQLite and production durability.
4. Queues and interactive control.
5. Hooks, events, and snapshots.
6. Compaction and navigation, then forks/subagents.
7. OpenCode-level product shell.
8. Amp-level remote execution.

## Priority fallback

1. Storage transactions/registers.
2. Minimal prompt run.
3. Crash restore/resume.
4. Durable sequential tools.
5. Abort/close.
6. SQLite.
7. Queues/steering/follow-up.
8. Events/watch.
9. Permissions/sandbox/worktrees.
10. Hooks.
11. Parallel tools.
12. Manual compaction.
13. Auto-compaction/overflow.
14. Multi-lane/navigation/fork.
15. Remote runners.
16. Advanced retention/schema evolution.

## Deferred

- JSONL unless required for product export, debug, or import.
- Postgres partitioning and retention daemon.
- Precise rewrite and general settlement-kernel migrations.
- Multi-lane, queues, compaction, navigation, and serving concerns until their ordered phases.
- SQLite FTS/search and coherent fork operations remain incomplete Part 8 slice-14 work assigned to the product-search and fork phases; Phase 3 does not claim the whole slice.
- Canonical extensible `AgentMessage` ownership and custom-role schemas until before custom messages or the product shell.
